# 100DaysOfCode_HH
100 Days of practising programming.
I extremely like the ideas of coffee and code, that s where it brought me to Codewars where I can practise the habit of daily coding. I believe no coders are overnight master, hence it comes with practice and practice and try to optimise the codes in term of performance as well KISS (keep it short and simple).
